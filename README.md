# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play called, **Fever.  The estimated budget for the play is over $10,000.  Naturally, Louise is nervous and hesitant as she is about to begin her first fundraising campaign.  As an excel power user, Louise looks to me for assistance.  I will organize, sort, and analyze the crowdfunding data to determine the specific factors that will help make Louise’s fundraising campaign a success.

## Analysis and Challenges
There were no extraordinary difficulties or challenges with Louise’s crowdfunding campaign data.  Not having enough data to analyze could have caused a delay for the project’s timeline.  Also, the statistical information would not be accurate enough to help Louise make any good decisions. Fortunately, none of those issues arose.
It was a simple task to produce an analysis and data visualization for Louise by providing her with two Pivot Tables and line charts.  A Pivot Table to analyze the results for Outcomes Based on Launch Date and the other was the results for Outcomes Based on Goals. The line Charts for each of these tables was an easy-to-understand depiction of what factors could help her launch a successful campaign.

## Results
Outcomes Based on Launch Date is the chart name for one of the visualization data analyses prepared for the client. The two conclusions which can be drawn from this data are: one of the most successful type of fundraising campaign is the theater.  The other is the graphic relationship between outcomes and launch month.  May, June, and July display a spike in the successful campaign which tapers off by the end of the year.
The data from the chart named, Outcomes based on Goals, depicts a different conclusion.  The most successful projects are the ones with a goal amount that is greater than $45,000.00 and less than $49,000.00.  
There are some limitations that could be encountered in a data analysis. For instance, the data could contain inaccurate information, poor data quality and format, as well as, missing information, and values.
In addition to the tables and line charts produced, other tables and/or graphs for Louise could be one which illustrates the campaign or campaigns that are most successful in other countries, as well as their peak months for performances.
